# Clerk automatically generates a new JSON Web Token (JWT) for each user upon sign-up or subsequent login each time ON DEMAND (clerk handles everything)
# This token is signed with Clerk's private key, and it contains information about the user, such as their ID and any custom claims you may have added.
# jwt is mainly used for user authentication and authorization purposes without the need to store session data on the server and no need to query the database for user information on every request.
# jwt itself alone already contains all the information needed to identify the user (very important)

# after user signup / login:
# User go through Clerk via email/password or Google OAuth or other methods
# Clerk issues a JWT based on a chosen template (with signature signed default by clerk private key)
# if its first time signing up, Clerk will create a new user and then fastapi will create corresponding user in Supabase through webhook.

# user auth flow:
# 1	Client sends HTTP request with header: Authorization: Bearer <jwt_token>
# 2	FastAPI sees Depends(security), runs security()
# 3	security() extracts token and wraps it inside HTTPAuthorizationCredentials class, and then it can used to retrieves jwt from it.
# 4	we then calls jwt.decode to verify and decode the JWT using Clerk's public keys
# 5	If OK, returns the decoded payload portion in dictionary + extracts the Clerk ID from the token
# 6	uses get_user_by_clerk_id to find the corresponding Supabase user and retrieve the final supabase user_id


# HTTPBearer is a class from fastapi.security that expects the client side to send a token in the HTTP "Authorization: Bearer <token>" header.
# this creates an instance of the HTTPBearer class, but this instance is also callable
# So while security is an instance of HTTPBearer, it also behaves like a function, to do something like security(request)
# it will do: 1. Read the incoming HTTP request. 2. Look for Authorization: Bearer <token>. 3. If has, it will extract the token and return it as an HTTPAuthorizationCredentials object.
security = HTTPBearer()

# Initialize the JWKS client
# This URL points to Clerk's public JSON Web Key Set (JWKS) â€” it contains the public keys that correspond to the private key Clerk uses to sign JWTs.
# we use this fetched public key to verify the JWT signature.

# HTTPAuthorizationCredentials: It's a small data class as pydantic model with two fields: "scheme" and "credentials".
